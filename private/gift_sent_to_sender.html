    <p>Thank you for sending a gift to {{person.name}}! You will receive a confirmation email once {{person.name}} logs in to the site to  confirm that they've received it.</p>
    <p>(If they don't do it soon, it might be worth it to email them a friendly nudge to confirm that they've received your gift, and so we don't mark you as a delinquent Santa. ;))</p>
