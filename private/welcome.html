    <p>Hello {{user.name}}!</p>
    <p>Thank you for signing up for our (secret) Secret Santa experiment. We'll let you know as soon as you're matched up with a recipient and with your own Secret Santa.</p>
    <p>Reminder: when you know who your recipient is, please send your virtual gift as soon as possible! All gifts are due by midnight GMT before Thursday, December 22nd.</p>
    <p>(And when you've received your own gift from your Secret Santa, please log back in to secretsanta.codebuddies.org/my-gift to confirm that you've recieved it, so we don't mark your Secret Santa as deliquent!)</p>
    <br />
    <p>P.S. If you're not sure what an appropriate ~$10 virtual gift might be, check out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a2IlrszEAGpi7rliphX3sibM9s3CHW0-4d1aKeZGlWU/edit" target="-blank">Google Doc</a> of ideas. As you can see, virtual gifts can be Amazon.com, Github, or iTunes gift cards, Kindle books, donations to charities, or anything else your recipient has expressed an interest in!</p>
    <p>P.P.S. This project was built primarily by @distalx, who initially thought of the idea and ran with it, and then asked more members from the CodeBuddies community to contribute to it. This project (like all CodeBuddies projects) is open-sourced on <a href="https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/secret-santa/">Github</a>.</p>
